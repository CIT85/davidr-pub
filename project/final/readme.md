# Why I chose gaming as my project topic.

Since I was 8 years old, gaming has always been a huge part of my life. I use it to connect with long distance friends and escape from the stresses of day to day life. I decided to focus on gaming because it is something I really love and want to share with others. I'm excited to finally give this project a try and hope I can create something cool.

# CSS Ruleset and Page Layout

Reset and Box Sizing to ensure conistent spacing

bodystyle is to set the font, color, and layout for flexbox

header and footer are styled to capture the attention of the person visiting the website.

navigation was given a flexbox layout for horizontal navigation.

main content was for background, padding, and border styling.

headings and links were given colored styling to make them stand out.

lists and table were styled to improve readability.

button hover effects were styles.

given these rules i believe it gives the pages a consistent and visually appealing design.

# Media Queries

Adjusted padding and navigation spacing and layout for media queries from mobile devices to extra large screens.
