        <h2>A Brief History of Arizona</h2>

        <p>Arizona's history dates back thousands of years, with evidence of ancient Native American cultures such as the Ancestral Puebloans and the Hohokam. In the 16th century, Spanish explorers arrived in the region, claiming it for Spain. Over the following centuries, Arizona was part of the Spanish Empire, then Mexico, and finally became part of the United States as a result of the Mexican-American War in 1848.</p>
        <p>Arizona became a separate territory in 1863, during the American Civil War, and was later admitted to the Union as the 48th state on February 14, 1912. Throughout its history, Arizona has been shaped by mining booms, the growth of cattle ranching, and the development of irrigation projects, leading to its current status as a diverse and dynamic state known for its natural beauty, cultural heritage, and outdoor recreational opportunities.</p>
        <p>The Wild West era in Arizona, from the mid-19th to early 20th century, was marked by lawlessness and clashes between settlers and Native American tribes. Outlaw gangs like the Cochise County Cowboys were notorious for cattle rustling and robberies. As Arizona moved towards statehood in 1912, the frontier was tamed with the railroad and stricter law enforcement, ending the Wild West's chaotic conditions.</p>
